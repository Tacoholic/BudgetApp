# BudgetApp
This is a a budget app built in JavaScript and jQuery that allows you to input two values (income and expenses), with their descriptions and display it on the UI. Also displays how much much, percentage wise, an expense is in regards to the total budget. Tested app using Cypress. Tech stack: Javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS.

As a result of buildind this app, I took a deeper dive into the world of JavaScript.DOM manipulation, Immediately Invoked Function Expression's, DOMstrings, and creating a data structure that allowe me to store my data, instead of using variables, are some of the things, amongst others, that I learned.
